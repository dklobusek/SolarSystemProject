# SolarSystemProject

This simulation offers an accurate and visually appealing representation of all the planets in the Solar System, including Pluto. The simulation is designed with the following key features:

- **Real-Time Start**: The simulation begins with the planets positioned according to the current date. Users can adjust the starting date within the time function as needed.
- **Precision with Kepler's Equations**: The planetary positions are computed using Kepler's equations and data from NASA's JPL Horizons system, starting from the J2000 epoch. Tests indicate that the simulation maintains accuracy within a few seconds when compared to the Horizon System.
- **Broad Temporal Range**: The simulation is valid over a wide range, from 3000 BC to 3000 AD.
- **Realistic Time Scaling**: The default time progression is set at 1 second = 1 Earth day, providing a clear view of the planets' motions.
- **True-to-Life Representation**: The XYZ axes are scaled equally, ensuring that the inclinations of planetary orbits are represented accurately.
- **Enhanced Visuals**: Both the Asteroid Belt and Kuiper Belt are included to enhance the visual appeal of the simulation.
- **Customizable Objects**: Users can easily add new celestial objects with ecliptic orbits by simply editing the accompanying .csv file.
