# SolarSystemProject

Simulation of all planets in Solar System and Pluto\
Main features:

a) Starts always at current date (can change it in time function)\
b) Simulation uses kepler equations and data from JPL/Horizon system (starting point J2000) to simulate actual position of the planet with great accuracy (tests show accuracy within few seconds of starting position - compared to Horizon System)\
c) Simulation is valid from 3000 BC to 3000 AD\
d) Default speed is set to 1 second = 1 earth day\
e) XYZ axis are equal, so object inclinations you see on the plot is real life representation\
f) Asteroid Belt and Kuiper Belt are added for pleasing view\
g) The program has the ability to add more objects with ecliptic orbits, just need to edit .csv file
